    question: "What's the difference between baking powder and baking soda?",
    answer:
      "Baking powder and baking soda are both leavening agents but work differently. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) needs an acid to activate and create rise in baked goods. Baking powder contains baking soda plus an acid, so it only needs moisture to activate. They're not directly interchangeable - baking powder can replace baking soda (use 3x more), but not vice versa without adding an acid like lemon juice or vinegar.",

    question: "What can I substitute for eggs in baking recipes?",
    answer:
      "There are several egg substitutes for baking: 1) For moisture and binding: Â¼ cup unsweetened applesauce, mashed banana, or yogurt per egg. 2) For leavening: 1 tsp baking soda mixed with 1 tbsp vinegar per egg. 3) For structure: 1 tbsp ground flaxseed or chia seeds mixed with 3 tbsp water (let sit for 15 minutes) per egg. The best substitute depends on the recipe's specific needs.",

    question: "What's the best way to store fresh herbs?",
    answer:
      "Different herbs require different storage methods. For soft herbs like cilantro, parsley, and basil: trim the stems, place in a jar with water like flowers, cover loosely with a plastic bag, and refrigerate. For woody herbs like rosemary, thyme, and sage: wrap loosely in a damp paper towel, place in a sealed container, and refrigerate. Most herbs can also be frozen in oil in ice cube trays or dried for longer storage.",
